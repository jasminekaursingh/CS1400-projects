# CS1400-projects
Projects from CS1400 - Intro to Programming and Problem Solving.
All projects in this repository are projects I did in CS1400 in Java.
Great majority of the code is my own, except for when the professor specifically gave us portions of the code to utilize in our bigger projects, such as the driver programs for classes we create.
Every file included in this repository is the direct script file, so they include my code(s) as well as my test cases/demostrations.
